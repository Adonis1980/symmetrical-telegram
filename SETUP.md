## Part 1: Prerequisites - Account Setup

Before you begin, you will need accounts for the following services. If you already have them, you can skip to the next part.

1.  **Google Account**: You need a Google account to use Google Sheets. You can use a personal Gmail account or a Google Workspace account.
2.  **HubSpot Account**: Sign up for a free HubSpot account.
    - Go to [HubSpot's website](https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/get-started) and sign up for the **Free CRM**.
3.  **Zapier Account**: You will need a paid Zapier plan to handle the complexity of these automations. The **Starter** plan is a good place to begin.
    - Go to [Zapier's website](https://zapier.com/) and sign up.
4.  **OpenAI Account**: You need an OpenAI API key for the AI agents to function.
    - Go to the [OpenAI API platform](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and sign up.
    - After signing up, go to the [API Keys section](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create a new secret key. Copy this key and save it somewhere secure for now.
    - You will also need to add a payment method to your OpenAI account for the API usage.

## Part 2: Google Sheets - Your Database

We will create a new Google Sheet to act as the central database for your stores, brands, orders, and activities.

1.  **Create a New Sheet**:
    - Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com) and create a new blank spreadsheet.
    - Name it **"RepRally Sales Database"**.

2.  **Create the Worksheets**: You need to create four separate tabs (worksheets) at the bottom. Rename them to the following and add the specified columns in the first row of each sheet.

    **a) `Stores` Worksheet**

    | Store ID | Store Name | Owner/Contact | Phone | Email | Instagram | Website | Address | City | Store Type | Status | First Contact Date | Last Contact Date | Notes |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

    **b) `Brands` Worksheet**

    | Brand ID | Brand Name | Category | Summary | Ideal Stores | Ideal Customers | Talking Points | Suggested Opening Order | Launch Date | Status |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

    **c) `Orders` Worksheet**

    | Order ID | Store ID | Brand ID | Order Date | Cases | SKUs | Order Type | Next Reorder Date | Notes |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

    **d) `Activities` Worksheet**

    | Activity ID | Store ID | Activity Type | Date | Raw Notes | AI Summary | Outcome | Next Step | Next Step Date |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

    **e) `Weekly Reports` Worksheet**

    | Week Start | Week End | New Stores | Total Orders | First Orders | Reorders | Total Cases | Calls | Visits | Emails | Conversion Rate | Report Link | Generated |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

    **f) `Daily Summaries` Worksheet**

    | Date | Total Tasks | Tasks Due | Overdue | Reorders | Email Sent | Timestamp |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Important**: Make sure the column headers are spelled *exactly* as shown above.

## Part 3: HubSpot CRM - Your Command Center

Next, we'll configure HubSpot to store the data generated by the AI agents.

1.  **Create Custom Properties**:
    - In your HubSpot account, click the **Settings** gear icon in the top right.
    - In the left sidebar, navigate to **Properties** (under Data Management).
    - Click **Create property**.
    - Create the following properties for **Contact** objects:

        | Label | Internal Name | Field Type | Description |
        |---|---|---|---|
        | Store Type | `store_type` | Single-line text | The category of the retail store (e.g., c-store, liquor). |
        | Instagram Handle | `instagram_handle` | Single-line text | The store's Instagram username without the @. |
        | Last Order Date | `last_order_date` | Date picker | The date of the customer's most recent order. |
        | Total Orders | `total_orders` | Number | A running count of total orders from this contact. |

2.  **Customize Your Deal Pipeline**:
    - Navigate to **Settings** > **Objects** > **Deals**.
    - Click the **Pipelines** tab.
    - Edit the default "Sales Pipeline" to include these stages:
        - `New Lead`
        - `Outreach Prepared`
        - `Contacted`
        - `Follow-up Needed`
        - `Proposal Sent`
        - `Closed Won`
        - `Closed Lost`

## Part 4: Zapier - The Automation Engine

This is the most involved part. You will create the five automation workflows (called "Zaps") that power the AI agents. For each agent, you will create a new Zap and configure it using the provided JSON files.

**First, Connect Your Accounts to Zapier:**

1.  Log in to your Zapier account.
2.  Go to the [My Apps](https://zapier.com/app/connections) page.
3.  Click **Add connection** and connect:
    - **Google Sheets**: Log in with your Google account.
    - **HubSpot**: Log in with your HubSpot account.
    - **OpenAI**: Provide the API key you created in Part 1.
    - **Email by Zapier**: This is a built-in Zapier app and requires no setup.

**Now, Create Each Zap:**

For each of the 5 agents, you will follow these steps:

1.  Go to your Zapier dashboard and click **Create Zap**.
2.  Instead of setting up a trigger, click the **Import** button (you may need to click the three dots `...` in the top right to find it).
3.  Open the corresponding JSON file from the `workflows` folder on your computer.
4.  Copy the entire content of the JSON file.
5.  Paste the JSON content into the import box in Zapier and click **Import**.
6.  Zapier will load the pre-built workflow. Now, you just need to connect your accounts to the steps.
7.  Go through each step in the Zap. If a step has a warning icon, it means you need to select your specific account (e.g., choose your Google Sheets account) and the correct Sheet/worksheet you created.
8.  **Pay close attention to steps that require customization**, as noted in the JSON files. This usually involves:
    - Selecting your specific Google Sheet (`RepRally Sales Database`).
    - Selecting the correct worksheet (`Stores`, `Orders`, etc.).
    - Setting your email address in "Email by Zapier" steps.
    - Setting your HubSpot Portal ID where needed.
9.  Once all steps are configured, **turn the Zap on**.

**Repeat this process for all 5 workflow files:**

- `agent1_zapier_workflow.json`
- `agent2_zapier_workflow.json`
- `agent3_zapier_workflow.json`
- `agent4_zapier_workflow.json`
- `agent5_zapier_workflow.json`

## Part 5: Final Testing

Your system is now set up! Let's test it to make sure everything is working correctly.

1.  **Test Agent 1 (Store Research)**:
    - Go to your "RepRally Sales Database" Google Sheet.
    - In the `Stores` worksheet, add a new row with a real store's name and city (e.g., "Joe's Liquor", "San Francisco").
    - Wait a few minutes. Check your email for a notification. The row in Google Sheets should be updated with the phone, email, etc. A new contact should also appear in HubSpot.

2.  **Test Agent 4 (Order Entry)**:
    - In the `Orders` sheet, add a new row with the `Store ID` from the test above, a `Brand ID` (you can make one up for now), `Order Date`, `Cases`, and `Order Type` (`first`).
    - Wait a few minutes. Check your email for an order confirmation. The `Orders` sheet should be updated with a `Next Reorder Date`. A new task should appear in HubSpot for the reorder reminder.

If the tests are successful, your AI-powered sales automation system is ready to go! If you encounter any errors, go back to the Zap in Zapier and check its **History** to diagnose the problem. The most common issues are incorrect column names or disconnected accounts.

**Congratulations! You are now ready to run your sales job from home.**
